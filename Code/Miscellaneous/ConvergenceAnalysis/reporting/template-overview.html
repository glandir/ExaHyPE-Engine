<h1>ExaHyPE Convergence report overview</h1>

<p>This is a convergence report generated at <strong>${DATE}</strong> on ${HOST} by ${WHOAMI}.

<h2>Simulations</h2>
<p>The following table gives an overview about the state and parameters of the individual
simulations which were run. In total, to run this convergence test, <strong>${TOTAL_CPU_HOURS}
CPU hours</strong> (node hours) have been burned.

${SIMULATION_TABLE}

<p>The following parameters have been constant for all runs, thus not appearing as columns
to avoid cluttering:

${CONSTANT_PARAMETERS}

<p>To inspect the specification files with all further parameters, go
straight into the <a href="./">simulations directory</a>.

<h2>Errors</h2>
<p>This plot shows the errors of the simulations compared to the exact solutions over the
simulation time. The errors are shown on the quantity <strong>${QUANTITY}</strong>.

${ERROR_SVG_FIGURE}

<h2>Convergence rates</h2>
<p>This plot shows the convergence rates of the individual simulations as comparisons between
different resolutions. The convergence rates are computed for the quantity <strong>${QUANTITY}</strong>.

${CONVERGENCE_SVG_FIGURE}

<h2>Final time convergence/error table</h2>
<p>The convergence order of these simulations is:
