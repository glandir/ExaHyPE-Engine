# ExaHyPE SRHD Shocktubes at different resolution

These scripts were used in July 2016 to create the first versions of the shocktubes
at different resolutions in order to investigate the limiter neccessarity.
The code was copied to the repository for archiving purposes.

In contrast, there are other scripts which do something similar but by not changing
`dx` but the polynomial order `p` which requires recompiling ExaHyPE.
