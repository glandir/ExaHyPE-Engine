# Run the example:
Run usertimeplot.py -help for more details.

# Build the documentation: 
The Makefile is only used for building
the documentation.

To do so, run:
make docdir
make html

The first command does only
create the folder 'doc' and
three subfolders.

# Delete the documentation
make clean
