Build a test
************

Generate the optimized kernel in Codegenerator directory with Codegenrator/generateAllDegrees.sh
Adapt the script variable (min/max order, path to Codegenerator) and Makefile preprocessor variable (in particular NVAR and NVARPAD = nvar with arch specific padding)
Run the sh script
If needed adapt glue file to include more/less order
make
Run the test
