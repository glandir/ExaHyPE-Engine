# Some simple helper scripts for Peano that make 
# working with Peano a bit more convenient.
#
# I usually place this folder in the same directory as the project folder.
# Please modify the environment variables in env_vars to your needs.
# 
# 1. Export the environment variables (This is mandatory):

source peano-helpers/env_vars

# Depending on what stage of a Peano project you are currently
# at, you can run the following scripts: 

# A) Create a new project (tab completion helps you):

peano-helpers/create_empty_project.sh

# B) Generate glue-code (tab completion helps you).
#   This also copies the Peano definitions to a backup folder
#   ${PROJ_NAME}_bak

peano-helpers/glue_project.sh

# C) Run make on the project

peano-helpers/build_project.sh

# NOTE: Please read the scripts and modify them to your own needs.
#       Note however that general settings like the Peano home dir, the project name etc. 
#       can be modified in the env_vars file.
