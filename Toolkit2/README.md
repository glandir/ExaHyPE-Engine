# ExaHyPE Toolkit v2

This is a new and slim Toolkit for ExaHyPE, written in Python and using JSON as the
specification file language.

The need for that was finally raised by memory limitations of SableCC, as discussed
in https://gitlab.lrz.de/exahype/ExaHyPE-Engine/issues/237

## Requirements

* Python3
* jsonschema (pip3 install jsonschema OR apt-get install python-json-schema-validator)
