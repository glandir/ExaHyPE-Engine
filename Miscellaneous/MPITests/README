DynamicReceivesBroadcast
========================
Simple example of a broadcast where rank 0 sends
a message of arbitrary length
to all other ranks. 
As the receivers do not know the length of the message,
they need to determine it first. They do that via calling an 
MPI_Probe variant and subsequently MPI_Get_count.
After the message length is known on the receiver side,
the receivers allocate a buffer and receive the message.


Compile via (replace mpicc by desired MPI compiler wrapper):
mpicc <options> DynamicReceiveBroadcast.cpp -o DynamicReceiveBroadcast

Compiler options:
 -DBlockingSend     - use a MPI_Send instead of a MPI_Isend and a subsequent MPI_Test calling while loop
 -DBlockingProbe    - use a blocking MPI_Probe instead of a MPI_IProbe calling while loop
 -DBlockingReceive  - use a MPI_Send instead of a MPI_Irecv and a subsequent MPI_Test calling while loop
