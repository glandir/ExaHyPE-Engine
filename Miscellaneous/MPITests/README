Broadcast
=========
Simple example of a broadcast where rank 0 sends
a message of fixed length to all other ranks. The receivers are aware
of the length of the expected message.
(Normally, it would suffice to know the maximum 
length of all expected messages as we only specify a
buffer on the receiver side and not the actual message length.)

Compile via (replace mpicc by desired MPI compiler wrapper):
mpicc <options> -std=c++11 Broadcast.cpp -o Broadcast

Compiler options:
 -DMessageSize=<value>  - specify the size of the broadcasted message (default: 100). The message size is known
                          on the sender and receiver side.
 -DCollectives          - use a collective operation for performing the broadcast on both sides, sender and receiver side
                          The other options below are ignored if this flag is set.
 -DBlockingSend         - use a MPI_Send instead of a MPI_Isend and a subsequent MPI_Test calling while loop
 -DWaitOnSends          - use a MPI_Waitall on the sender side instead of the MPI_Test calling while loop
 -DBlockingReceive      - use a MPI_Send instead of a MPI_Irecv and a subsequent MPI_Test calling while loop
 -DWaitOnSends          - use a MPI_Wait on the receiver side instead of the MPI_Test calling while loop

DynamicReceivesBroadcast
========================
Simple example of a broadcast where rank 0 sends
a message of arbitrary length
to all other ranks. 
As the receivers do not know the length of the message,
they need to determine it first. They do that via calling an 
MPI_Probe variant and subsequently MPI_Get_count.
After the message length is known on the receiver side,
the receivers allocate a buffer and receive the message.

Compile via (replace mpicc by desired MPI compiler wrapper):
mpicc <options> -std=c++11 DynamicReceiveBroadcast.cpp -o DynamicReceiveBroadcast

Compiler options:
 -DMessageSize <value>  - specify the size of the broadcasted message (default: 100). The message size is only known
                          on the sender side, not on the receiver side.
 -DBlockingSend         - use a MPI_Send instead of a MPI_Isend and a subsequent MPI_Test calling while loop
 -DBlockingProbe        - use a blocking MPI_Probe instead of a MPI_IProbe calling while loop
 -DBlockingReceive      - use a MPI_Send instead of a MPI_Irecv and a subsequent MPI_Test calling while loop
 -DTobiasReceives       - use Tobas's receive strategy which bascially consists of a while loop around a non-blocking MPI_IProbe.
                          If the IProbe finds a message with the right tag, it issues a non-blocking MPI_Irecv. The non-blocking 
                          receive is then tested and if the test successful, it means we have received the message. 
                          Otherwise, we return to the start of the loop.
                          
CartesianExchange
========================
This test models neighbour exchange patterns as they appear in Discontinuous Galerkin and
Godunov Finite Volumes codes. We consider a Cartesian topology for the involved MPI ranks.

We investigate here the tradeoff between message size and number of messages with
respect to the total time spent posting sends and receives, waiting for their completion,
and clearing all involved buffers afterwards.

We consider different message sizes starting with sizes 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, ... going up to 
a user-prescribed maximum message size. We further consider splits of each message into smaller
message parts (packets). The splits are performed using
a sequence of divisors 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, ... .
We divide the original length until the packet size equals 1 (incl.).

Compile via (replace mpicc by desired MPI compiler wrapper):
mpicc <options> -DUseVector -std=c++11 CartesianExchange.cpp -o CartesianExchange

Compiler options:
 -DUseVector - Use a vector instead of a list for storing the send/receive requests.

Please run the program the following way: 
  
mpirun -np <numberOfRanks> ./CartesianExchange <dimensions> <maximumMessageSize> <numberOfTests>
  
Here, the required command line arguments 'dimensions', 'maximumMessageSize', and 'numberOfTests'
are all positive integers.
