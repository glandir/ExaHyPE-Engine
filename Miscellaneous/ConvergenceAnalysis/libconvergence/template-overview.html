<h1>ExaHyPE Convergence report overview</h1>

<p>This is a convergence report generated at <strong>${DATE}</strong> on ${HOST} by ${WHOAMI}.

<p>At this test, <strong>ExaHyPE ${CONVERGENCE_PASSED}</strong>. For details see below.


<h2>Simulations</h2>
<p>The following table gives an overview about the state and parameters of the individual
simulations which were run. In total, to run this convergence test, <strong>${TOTAL_CPU_HOURS}
CPU hours</strong> (node hours) have been burned.

${SIMULATION_TABLE}

<p>The following parameters have been constant for all runs, thus not appearing as columns
to avoid cluttering:

${CONSTANT_PARAMETERS}

<p>To inspect the specification files with all further parameters, go
straight into the <a href="./">simulations directory</a>.

<h2>Errors</h2>
<p>This plot shows the errors of the simulations compared to the exact solutions over the
simulation time. The errors are shown on the quantity <strong>${QUANTITY}</strong>.

${ERROR_SVG_FIGURE}

<h2>Timestep sizes</h2>
<p>This plot, if present, shows the sizes of the timesteps of the individual simulations.
They have to be extracted from the ExaHyPE logfiles. The <a href="${LINK_DETAILED_REPORT}">detailed
report</a> contains the average timesteps for each simulation.</p>

${TIMESTEP_SVG_FIGURE}

<h2>Convergence rates</h2>
<p>This plot shows the convergence rates of the individual simulations as comparisons between
different resolutions. The convergence rates are computed for the quantity <strong>${QUANTITY}</strong>.

${CONVERGENCE_SVG_FIGURE}

<h2>Final time convergence/error table</h2>
<p>For a final time, we display the convergence numbers in the following table. It is
<em>l1norm</em> the Manhattan norm, <em>l2norm</em> the Euclidean norm, <em>max</em> the
infinity norm (maximum norm). The values <em>o1norm</em>, <em>o2norm</em> and <em>omax</em>
are the computed convergence orders for thes enorms.

${COMBINED_FINAL_CONVERGENCE_ERRROR_TABLE}

<p>By summing up the difference between the ideal scaling (convergence rate = polynomial order + 1)
and the real scaling in all norms, we have an average factor of <strong>${CONVERGENCE_QUALITY_INDICATOR}</strong>.
This factor should be at the order of unity. We deduce: ExaHyPE <strong>${CONVERGENCE_PASSED}</strong>.

<h2>Evolution data</h2>

<p>To inspect much more details, you may either proceed to the <a href="./">simulations
directory</a> or to the <a href="${LINK_DETAILED_REPORT}">detailed report with all the
evolution data</a>.
