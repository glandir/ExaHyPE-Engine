    """
    Reads multiple Peano output files with the naming pattern
       '<prefix>_n<#MPI proc.>_t<#threads/MPI proc.>_r<#run>_<cc>_<mode>.txt'

    and computes the average, minimum, and maximum CPU and user times for 
    each process and thread tuple. Averaging as well as searching for
    minima and maxima is performed over the number of runs 'n_runs'.

    Note:
       If the input array 'thread_counts' contains the entry 1,
       then the script looks for an output file
       with suffix 'None.txt' for this particular
       number of threads.

    Args:
       rootdir (str):
          Directory containing the Peano output files.
       prefix (str): 
          Prefix of the files - usually the date of the test and an identifier for the machine and the MPI process that has written the output files.
       process_counts (int[]):
          Number of MPI processes.
       thread_counts (int[]):
          Number of threads per node.
       n_runs (int):
          Number of runs for each 'n' and 'p' combination [default=1].
       cc (str):
          Compiler [default=gcc]. 
       mode (str):
          Shared memory mode [default=TBB].
       per_iteration (bool):
          Specifies if the times per iteration should be read in instead of the total times.

    Returns:
       A dict holding for each of the adapters a nested dict that holds the following key-value pairs:
          * 'n'           : (int)         Number of times this adapter was used.
          * 'avg_cputime' : (float[][]) CPU time spent within the adapter averaged over 'n_runs' runs.
          * 'min_cputime' : (float[][]) Minimum CPU time spent within the adapter out of 'n_runs' runs.
          * 'max_cputime' : (float[][]) Maximum CPU time spent within the adapter out of 'n_runs' runs.
