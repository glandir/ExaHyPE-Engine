 * These constants should be created by the toolkit instead

 * write naked numbers somewhere, as in
 *   ADERDGSolver("SRHDSolver", 3, 2, ...)
 * is called "magic numbers" and they are accepted as bad
 * coding practice.
 * 
 * As we currently cannot run the toolkit for SRHD,
 * these constants have to be always kept equal to the
 * toolkit.
