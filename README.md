## Commit guidelines ##

Please
* Run tests before you commit

*    Don't commit the following:
    
     * Binary files (\*\.o, executables, \.\.\. ) excluding those necessary for the documentation 
    
     * Output files (\*\.vtk, logs, \.\.\. )

### Commit message template 
We should try to write good commit messages that document
every change we introduced into the code.

What do you think about the following template?  
(Source: http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Contributing-to-a-Project)

Template:  

    Short (50 chars or less) summary of changes

    More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to
    about 72 characters or so.  In some contexts, the first
    line is treated as the subject of an email and the rest of
    the text as the body.  The blank line separating the
    summary from the body is critical (unless you omit the body
    entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run
    the two together.
    
    Further paragraphs come after blank lines.
    
    - Bullet points are okay, too
    
    - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet,
      preceded by a single space, with blank lines in
      between, but conventions vary here"
