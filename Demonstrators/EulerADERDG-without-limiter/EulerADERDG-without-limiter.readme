How to install:
===============

All data required for this demonstrator can be found within one single file. 
To translate it, you need at least a Java installation and a C++ compiler. 
Optimisations then need Intel's TBB, MPI or even Python (depends on the 
variant).  


1.1. Build the toolkit (if not done before):
- Change into Toolkit directory
- Type 
   ./build.sh

1.2. Generate all gluecode
- Change into the ExaHyPE root directory (the one hosting Toolkit)
- Type in
   java -jar Toolkit/dist/ExaHyPE.jar Demonstrators/EulerADERDG-without-limiter/EulerADERDG-without-limiter.exahype


A first build/test
==================

2.1. Change into Demonstrators/EulerADERDG
- Set minimalist environment variables
  export SHAREDMEM=none
  export DISTRIBUTEDMEM=none
  
2.2. Open the EulerADERDG-without-limiter.exahype file (it is a text file) and ensure that

    plot vtu::Cartesian::vertices::ascii EulerWriter
      variables const = 5
      time            = 0.0
      repeat          = 0.001
      output          = ./variables
    end plot

  is set. These settings should be the default but as the project is under
  active development, you never know.  
  
2.3. Type in 
  make

  If you prefer the GNU compiler, type in 

  export COMPILER=gnu
  
  You can set all compiler variables through the command environment variables 
  dumped if you type in make. Some linkers fail with ExaHyPE. In this case, you
  have to set
  
  export EXAHYPE_CC="g++ -lpthread"
  
  or similar. 
  
  Remark: Note, if you 
  
2.4. Run the code with 
  ./ExaHyPE-EulerADERDG EulerADERDG-without-limiter.exahype
  
2.5. Study the resulting files with Paraview, e.g.
 

AMR
===

To enable dynamic AMR, open the config file and alter the line 

    maximum-mesh-depth         = 0

Set any integer greater 0 you want. I recommend to start with 1.


Benchmarking
============

3.1. Preparation: for benchmarking, it pays off to disable all file dumps/IO. 
  To do so, it is sufficent to set the time value within the plotter to a very
  high number. The value in there says when the first snapshot is due. If the 
  simulation never hits this time stamp, then nothing is plotted at all.
  
3.2. To enable shared memory, set the environment variable

  export SHAREDMEM=tbb
  
  and recompile. To alter the number of cores, you have to alter the value 
  of cores in the config file's section  shared-memory.
  
3.3. To enable distributed memory, set the environment variable

  export DISTRIBUTEDMEM=mpi
  
  and recompile.

3.4. To enable the optimised kernels (compute kernels annotated with pragmas, 
  padding, alignment, ...) you have to contact TUM's Michael Bader.
