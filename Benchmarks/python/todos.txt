sweep/sweep_options:

- tasks per node -> ranks in ini file
   tasks per node are computed on the fly and the max value is passed to
   the user script
   Can be picked up by job template if needed
   Q: Does SLURM equally distribute the ranks? (That's what we want!)

- provide job grouping for environment as well

- if cores>1 and SHAREDMEMORY=None, print out warning

sweep_analysis:

- parse the number of unrefined cells from the
  peano output

- write out comma separated files using quotation marks for quoting
  text
